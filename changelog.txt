...
 draw()
    ontimer(move, 20)   # you can change the speed from 1 (very fast) to 50 (very slow)


3. The third change was the implemented score board, which encreases if a target gets hit:

# prints the score on the screen
score = 0  # Starting with a score of 0
...
goto(-200, 185)
    write(f"Score: {score} | Lives: {lives}", align="left", font=("Arial", 16, "normal"))
...
for target in dupe:
        if abs(target - ball) > 13:
