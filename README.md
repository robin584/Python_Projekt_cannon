In this project "Cannon Game" I will expand the existing game with the following points in relation to our WDIC lessons:
 
1. Vary the gravitational effect.  
2. Adjust the speed of the ball.
3. Keep score by counting target hits.
4. Implement a life counter.  
5. Losing a life occurs when the target hits the left wall.  
6. Create a GAME OVER screen.  
7. Hitting a black target also results in losing a life.  
8. Hitting a yellow target grants a extra life.  
9. Visualize a real cannon.
