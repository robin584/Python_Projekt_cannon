In this project "Cannon Game" I will expand the existing game with the following points in relation to our WDIC lessons:

1. Keep score by counting target hits.  FIN
2. Vary the gravitational effect.  FIN
3. Adjust the speed of the ball.  FIN
4. Implement a life counter.  FIN
5. Losing a life occurs when the target hits the left wall.  
6. Create a GAME OVER screen.  FIN
7. Hitting a black target also results in losing a life.  FIN
8. Hitting a yellow target grants a extra life.  FIN
9. Visualize a real cannon.
