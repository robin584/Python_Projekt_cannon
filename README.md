In this project "Cannon Game" I will expand the existing game with the following points in relation to our WDIC lessons:

1. Keep score by counting target hits.
2. Vary the gravitational effect.
3. Generate new targets with different shape and colour.
4. Adjust the speed of the ball.
5. Implement a life counter.
6. Losing a life occurs when the target hits the left wall.
7. Create a GAME OVER screen.
8. Hitting a black target also results in losing a life.
9. Hitting a yellow target grants a extra life.
10. Visualize a real cannon.
